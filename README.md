# Scraping the Web

Today, Friday, August 04, 2023, I will begin to learn about web scraping in Python. It honestly sounds kind of gross. But I ably worked the deep sink for four months while I mess cranked in the galley aboard the USS LaSalle. I scraped and scrubbed a lot of pots and pans in that role. So I may be a natural at web scraping.

I'm 80% completed with Jose Portilla's Python boot camp, and I'm trying to finish before Monday when I start IBM's data science course. So I'll get going.
