# Scraping the Web

Today, Friday, August 04, 2023, I will begin to learn about web scraping in Python. It honestly sounds kind of gross. But I ably worked the deep sink for four months while I mess cranked in the galley aboard the USS LaSalle. I scraped and scrubbed a lot of pots and pans in that role. So I may be a natural at web scraping.

I'm 80% completed with Jose Portilla's Python boot camp, and I'm trying to finish before Monday when I start IBM's data science course. So I'll get going.

Update, Saturday, August 05, 2023: I'm off and running with learning web scraping. Beautiful soup is a pretty cool library that has given me a more clear understanding of what libraries are. They're add ons of Python functionality created by good samaritans. And I'm going to love using them. Some form of web scraping for freely available data to use in machine learning or AI seems like it must be pretty common. Maybe that's why it's part of Jose's course. Hmmmm.
